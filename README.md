SQL Challenge Module 9

This project is a practice in connecting with databases through SQL.
It is a simulation that suggests that I was hired as a new data engineer at (fictional company) Pewlett Hackard. The assignment is to dive into their employment records. Some are old spreadsheets and need to be combined to achieve the following:

1) List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2) List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3) List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4) List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5) List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6) List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7) List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8) List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employees last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
